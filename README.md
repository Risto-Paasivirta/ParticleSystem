We could really use a catchy name ^^

`clone the repository
After you have cloned the repository just open the PowerShell in the project folder and run:

"npm i" 
To install the node js packages.

"npm run dev" 
To run the real time test environment. The web page should get automatically refreshed when you modify the code.

If you are getting a warning or error message make sure you have the latest node.js installed.
You can check which version you have by typing "node" in shell. I am running v16.13.2`
