# Lightweight Particle System for TypeScript with example PIXI.js integration

We could really use a catchy name ^^

## Development

1. Install all the dependencies.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Run internal applications located in "./apps" folder.

    Open _CMD/Terminal_ to serve example applications and watch changes in the `./apps` and `./src` folder.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Commands

-   `npm run build` - starts build procedure
-   `npm run start` - starts development server, watching for files changes and automatically refreshes the webpage
-   `npm run test` - run tests
-   `npm run code-coverage` - generate code coverage report
-   `npm run code-style-check` - run's eslint and prettier check on your code

For vscode users - ctrl ( or âŒ˜ ) + shift + b will run the watch build as its set as default vscode task
